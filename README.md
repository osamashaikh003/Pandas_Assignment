# Pandas Practice Assignment

This repository contains my solutions for a Pandas practice assignment, designed to enhance proficiency in data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library in Python.

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of various Pandas functionalities to perform data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. The assignment focuses on applying Pandas to solve practical data manipulation tasks.

## Assignment Details


* "The assignment required loading, cleaning, and transforming a dataset using Pandas, followed by performing various data analysis operations."
* "We were tasked with practicing data manipulation techniques like filtering, grouping, merging, and pivoting using Pandas."
* "The assignment focused on using Pandas to analyze and extract insights from a given CSV dataset."

## Project Structure

## Tools and Libraries

* **Python:** Programming language used.
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Numerical computing (often used in conjunction with Pandas).
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive coding and documentation environment.

## Key Implementations

* **Data Loading and Inspection:** Loading data from CSV files and inspecting data structures using `read_csv()`, `head()`, `info()`, etc.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
* **Data Transformation:** Filtering, sorting, and creating new columns using Pandas functionalities.
* **Data Aggregation:** Grouping and summarizing data using `groupby()` and aggregation functions.
* **Data Merging and Joining:** Combining data from multiple DataFrames using `merge()` and `join()`.
* **Data Pivoting and Reshaping:** Reshaping data using `pivot_table()` and `melt()`.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating basic plots using Pandas' built-in plotting capabilities.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3.  Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy jupyter`
4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook pandas_practice.ipynb` (or `pytest test_cases.py` if tests are included)

## Learning Outcomes


* "Enhanced my proficiency in using Pandas for data manipulation and analysis."
* "Improved my ability to clean and transform real-world datasets using Pandas."
* "Gained practical experience in performing data aggregation and merging operations."
* "Strengthened my understanding of Pandas functionalities for data reshaping and pivoting."
* "Practiced using Pandas for basic data visualization."
